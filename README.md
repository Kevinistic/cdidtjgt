# CDID Truck Job Grind Tracker
pretty useless app i created with python and tkinter on my free time. i figured this would be VERY useful for those playing CDID 24/7.
using it is pretty straightforward, just click the start button and you're good to go.

if you're a brainlet who needs guidance;
1. enter your current money on the box
2. press update to send the data to the program
3. start trucking. when you reach your destination, enter your new money and press update.
4. rinse and repeat baby woohoo!

a better guide and README will be coming soon.
