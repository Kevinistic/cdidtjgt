# CDID Truck Job Grind Tracker
pretty useless app i created with python and tkinter on my free time. i figured this would be VERY useful for those playing CDID 24/7.
using it is pretty straightforward, just click the start button and you're good to go.

## Installation
1. download the app [here](https://github.com/Kevinistic/cdidtjgt/releases/)
2. extract it somewhere
3. voila! you're done. open the .exe program to use.
otherwise, create a shortcut to the .exe file to your desktop for quick access ig

## Guidance
if you're a brainlet who needs guidance;

1. enter your current money on the box
2. press the 'update' button to send the data to the program
3. start trucking. when you reach your destination, enter your new money and press update.
4. rinse and repeat baby woohoo!
5. p.s. the 'restart' button resets all the datas inside the program. only press it when you know what you're doing.

## Plans
- ~~pause feature~~
- new buttons, possibly new gui
- new gui cuz tkinter is hella outdated man :skull:
- mac support soon (?)

## Contribution
this is currently a solo project, and it'll stay that way for a long time. unless, you can convince me otherwise. let me know in Discord (@cn3z).

a better README will be coming soon.
