# CDID Truck Job Grind Tracker
pretty useless app i created with python and tkinter on my free time. i figured this would be VERY useful for those playing CDID 24/7.
using it is pretty straightforward, just click the start button and you're good to go.

## Installation
uhh, idk, just download the .exe file [here](https://github.com/Kevinistic/cdidtjgt/releases/tag/v1.0)?

## Guidance
if you're a brainlet who needs guidance;

1. enter your current money on the box
2. press the 'update' button to send the data to the program
3. start trucking. when you reach your destination, enter your new money and press update.
4. rinse and repeat baby woohoo!
5. p.s. the 'restart' button resets all the datas inside the program. only press it when you know what you're doing.

## Contribution
sure ig, let me know in Discord (@cn3z) and we'll discuss it further.

a better README will be coming soon.
